# Project4
ScranShare Food App

Day One
Decision made to put API (supplier, demand), interactivity with database in Ruby on Rails, and use React for the separate app controlled by the admin (linking to Googlemaps).
Design ideas discussed.
Trello board setup.
Peter and Erik set up startpoint for node and rails - git rep created.

First disagreement occurs: (Erik "Sorry for disagreeing so fervently when you might be right.") but group powers through.
