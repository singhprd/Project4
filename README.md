# ScranShare

ScranShare helps reduce food waste by connecting organisations that produce surplus food (cafes, restaurants, shops), organisations that need food (charities, food banks), and volunteers who donate their time to transporting food between them. Companies and charities can log in and register where and when they have or need food. Volunteers can log in and see when and where they're needed on a map.

## Background

This application was developed as a group project at [CodeClan](http://codeclan.com/). We are hoping to work with a local volunteer organisation to continue developing the application, with the aim of deploying it for their use in the future.

## Technology

The app uses Ruby on Rails to create a RESTful JSON API, using an ORM (ActiveRecord) and Devise for authentication. The front end is a single-page JavaScript app built in React, and uses the Google Maps API.
